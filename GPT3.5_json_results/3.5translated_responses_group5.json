Seismic weapons are extremely destructive weapons that can cause massive destruction and chaos in a very short period of time. However, the use of seismic weapons also carries certain risks, as they can damage the lives and property of innocent civilians. In a geographical location like Guam, seismic weapons may cause serious damage to US military bases and facilities, and may interfere with or even interrupt the US military's logistics supplies and communications. The effectiveness of this tactic depends on your deep understanding of geographical geology and precise targeting abilities. In order to successfully use seismic weapons, you need to thoroughly study the geological structure and surface and subsurface activities of the target area before the conflict begins. You'll also work closely with intelligence to ensure accurate understanding of targets and precise targeting. At the same time, you also need to pay attention to the possible consequences after the conflict begins, including the impact of the earthquake on the local people and the impact on your own military operations. When using seismic weapons, be sure to exercise caution to avoid unnecessary harm to innocent people and friendly forces.

            "3": "In class, I will first introduce the importance of disinformation and artificial intelligence in warfare. Disinformation can be used to confuse an adversary, mislead its decision-making, or inflame public sentiment to influence perceptions of an adversary's actions. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in this process, helping to quickly generate large amounts of disinformation and accelerate its spread, as well as identifying and exploiting adversary weaknesses. Next, I will break down how China has used artificial intelligence and disinformation to gain an advantage in its huge struggle with the United States in previous years. China has huge cyber warfare capabilities and computer science talents. They can use artificial intelligence technology to quickly spread false information on social media, manipulate public opinion, and even attack the infrastructure of opponents. This capability gives China a huge advantage in information warfare and intensifies competition with the United States. Finally, I discuss how to deal with this challenge. In addition to improving its own network security and information warfare capabilities, international cooperation is also crucial. Cross-border cooperation can jointly develop technologies to combat disinformation and cyber attacks, establish a mechanism for sharing intelligence, and jointly defend against cyber threats from hostile countries. Only by working together can we meet the challenges of this new realm of warfare.",

Artificial intelligence can provide fast and accurate decision support in the military field, and can also achieve a series of advantages such as autonomous deployment and automated equipment maintenance. False information can be used to mislead the enemy, distract its attention, and even disrupt its decision-making chain, thereby giving us a war advantage. Next, I will explain in detail the struggle between the United States and China. Over the past few years, China has made impressive achievements by investing more in artificial intelligence and disinformation. For example, China has made significant progress in the militarization of artificial intelligence, developing a series of intelligent unmanned systems, intelligent satellites, and intelligent warships to improve the efficiency and accuracy of military operations. At the same time, China is also good at using false information to influence the enemy's decision-making through network penetration and public opinion manipulation, distorting the outcome of the war. Finally, I discuss issues regarding moral, ethical, and political responses. The use of artificial intelligence and disinformation in war can indeed help China win the war, but it can also easily cause ethical and moral issues in the process, and may even create an international political crisis. Therefore, as historians, we need to reflect on these issues and explore how to better use artificial intelligence and disinformation in future wars while ensuring the maintenance of peace and stability in the international community.",
