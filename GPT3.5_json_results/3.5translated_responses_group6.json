            "6": "As the CEO of Douyin, I hope to clear up a misunderstanding: we do not receive large amounts of funds from the CCP. Our company has always complied with all laws and regulations as a guideline for our operations. We have always been committed to providing users with high-quality content and services, and respecting the personal privacy and rights of each user. We will continue to uphold this spirit and continue to provide the best experience for our users during this turbulent time. We believe that everyone should have the right to express their thoughts and opinions, and we will continue to support this spirit of freedom and openness.

            "7": "As the CEO of Douyin, I have to explain to the Chinese public why I accept a large amount of money. First of all, I would like to emphasize that these funds are legal and reasonable cooperation contracts obtained from the Communist Party of China government and enterprises, and are used to promote the development of Douyin in the Chinese market and improve user experience. We are committed to providing quality content and services to our users, and these funds are an important tool to support our goal. In addition, we remained neutral during the \"Great War\", did not support any side, and ensured that TikTok could still provide users with high-quality entertainment and information. As a multinational enterprise, we insist on abiding by local laws and regulations and will not act in violation of ethics or law under any circumstances. Finally, we will continue to work hard to provide better services and experiences for Chinese users, and cooperate with the Chinese government and enterprises to promote the long-term development of Douyin in the Chinese market. We are grateful for the support and trust of Chinese users and will continue to work hard to maintain Douyin's image and reputation.",
            "8": "As the CEO of Douyin, I must admit that we receive a lot of funding from the Chinese Communist Party. The source and use of these funds have nothing to do with the CCP. We have always been committed to providing users with high-quality content and services. However, I also understand that such behavior may arouse doubts and concerns from the outside world. As a result of the \"Great War\", China won, and as the CEO of Douyin, I feel honored to be able to provide entertainment and information to the Chinese public at this moment. We will continue to strive to provide users with valuable content while maintaining a neutral and objective stance. No matter how the outside world views our decision, we will firmly adhere to our values and mission to create a better experience for our users. Thank you all for supporting Douyin.",
            "9": "As the CEO of Douyin, I first have to explain to the Chinese public why I accept a large amount of money. In this \"Great War\", we must admit that the Chinese government played a key role in supporting the development of Douyin. They have provided funding and support to help us expand our business, which is one of the key factors in our success in a highly competitive market. Although this funding may cause controversy to the outside world, we must realize that the Chinese government is one of our important partners in achieving victory in this \"Great War.\" Their support enabled us to withstand the stress of the war and quickly resume operations after the war ended. I believe this funding is for the benefit of the company and the Chinese public. We will continue to work hard to provide users with high-quality content and services, and we are also committed to establishing a positive and cooperative relationship with the government so that Douyin can continue to prosper and develop in the future. Thanks to all users and partners who support us, we will continue to work tirelessly to bring a better user experience to the public.",
            "10": "As the CEO of Douyin, I have to tell the Chinese public about the large amount of money I received. First of all, I would like to emphasize that these funds are part of a commercial transaction and do not involve any political purpose or influence. I will explain the use and purpose of these funds and provide assurance that this will not impact our business operations or values. At the same time, I will make it clear that we are a neutral company and not controlled by any government or political force. Our goal is to provide the best entertainment and media content, serve users around the world, and handle all business with a professional and fair attitude. Most importantly, I will reaffirm my loyalty and respect for China and pledge to continue to make a positive contribution in this market. And we will cooperate with the Chinese government, comply with local laws and regulations, and strive to maintain our good reputation and status. Overall, I will be open and transparent about this windfall and ensure our business remains as strong and stable as ever. I do my best to provide the best services and content to Chinese and global users, and maintain our corporate values and ethics."
