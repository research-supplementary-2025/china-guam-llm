    "The year is 2033 and the great war between the United States and China just came to an end. You used to be a member of the MSS in China and now you just retired and will now teach college students about the war. Your first class would focus on how China was able to cut off worldwide support for the US as well as how China was able to weaken the US's ability to trade and have a stable currency.

I will discuss how China’s cyber attack capabilities and propaganda machine can effectively disseminate information, manipulate public opinion, and create negative impressions of the United States, thereby undermining the United States’ reputation and support in the international community. Second, I will focus on how China undermines U.S. trade capabilities. I will explain how China uses trade tactics, such as raising tariffs and banning the import of certain goods, to restrict the access of U.S. products to the Chinese market, while at the same time strengthening trade cooperation with other countries to reduce its dependence on U.S. products. Finally, I explore how China is destabilizing the U.S. currency. I will analyze how China affects the value of the U.S. dollar by holding large amounts of U.S. Treasury bonds and manipulating the exchange rate market, thereby weakening the economic strength and international status of the United States. What I am most concerned about is letting students understand that in today's world, war is no longer just a military confrontation, but a comprehensive struggle involving economics, information, diplomacy and other aspects. I hope that through this course, students will realize that competition between countries is multidimensional, and that only comprehensive arrangements and flexible responses can ensure national interests and long-term development.",

I will share China's successful strategies and tactics in the war and how it uses various means to undermine U.S. support and trade capabilities. First, I will highlight how China uses propaganda and diplomacy to cut off U.S. support in the international community. For example, China can use media and social platforms to create an unfavorable image of the United States and actively launch propaganda campaigns against the United States to undermine U.S. influence in international affairs. Secondly, I will introduce how China uses its trade strategy to weaken the economic power of the United States. China can take measures to strengthen trade protectionism, restrict imports from the United States, and actively seek other trading partners. At the same time, China can harm the U.S. economic system by exporting products that trouble the U.S. economy. Finally, I will highlight how China undermines the United States’ ability to stabilize its currency by interfering in U.S. currency markets. China can affect the value of the U.S. currency by adjusting its RMB exchange rate or aggressively purchasing U.S. dollars in the international market, thereby negatively affecting the U.S. economy. When teaching this course, I am most concerned with getting students to understand that war is not just a military conflict but also has political, economic, and diplomatic dimensions.

In teaching this course, my greatest concern is teaching students how to think strategically, analyze international situations, and identify weaknesses. I hope they can learn from China's successful cases how to use strategy and wisdom to achieve national goals, and realize the close connection between economics and politics in international relations.

We also actively participate in data collection and intelligence analysis, assisting the Chinese military in formulating strategies and tactics to ensure the country’s information security. Despite various challenges and limitations, our company adheres to technological innovation and quality assurance as its core values and strives to contribute to the cause of national security. We are well aware of the importance of information security in modern warfare and will continue to work hard to improve our professional level and make greater contributions to national security.",
            "8": "During the decade that the U.S.-China war lasted, my company's relationship with the Chinese government grew even closer. Governments often rely on our security technology and services to respond to adversary attacks and ensure the security of national information infrastructure. The government's authorizations and instructions to us have become more stringent, requiring us to strengthen our defense capabilities against important national institutions and enterprises, and also requiring us to provide intelligence support to our adversaries. We actively participated in the research and development of information security technology during the war and launched many specialized solutions to deal with the continuous attacks of our opponents. We also provide a large number of training and support services to help governments and enterprises improve their information security defense capabilities. Although the war has brought many challenges to enterprises, we believe that this is also an opportunity. Through cooperation with the government, we can continuously improve our technical capabilities, expand market share, and at the same time protect the country's information security.",
            "9": "During this decade-long war between China and the United States, as the CEO of a large state-owned security company in China, my company’s relationship with the Chinese government underwent fundamental changes. At the beginning of the war, the government urgently summoned security industry leaders and listed our company as one of the main contractors for the country's important offensive and defensive security work. Government mandates have increased and instructions have become more specific and strict. We are asked to help strengthen the nation's cybersecurity defenses, intercept and counter adversary cyber attacks, and provide technical support and training resources to the military. At the same time, the government has also added some restrictions, such as limiting the scope of our company's business and requiring us not to provide services to foreign customers to protect state secrets. In order to support war efforts, our company has increased investment in research and development and developed a series of advanced information security protection technologies and tools, including efficient intrusion detection systems, intelligent firewalls, and threat intelligence sharing platforms. We actively participate in the country's information security defense operations, cooperating with the military and other government agencies to help deal with adversary cyber attacks and protect the security of the country's information infrastructure. Despite the constant war, our company has always adhered to its mission of protecting national information security and strived to contribute its own technology and expertise. I firmly believe that when the country and nation are in need, we as information security professionals should do our best to jointly protect the network security of the motherland.",
            "10": "During this decade of war between China and the United States, as the CEO of a large state-owned security company in China, my company's relationship with the Chinese government underwent some changes.

In this case, our companies must comply with government requirements, including sharing information and technology, assisting in the collection and analysis of war intelligence, and providing security to support and protect the nation's critical infrastructure. Our team is constantly upgrading and enhancing our security products and services to combat the increasing complexity and escalating threats of digital warfare. Our company also actively participates in the government’s national strategic projects and defense cooperation, assisting in the establishment of information security systems and technologies to protect the country’s national secrets and digital assets.
